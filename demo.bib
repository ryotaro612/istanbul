  abstract = {The semantic study of system F stumbles on the problem of variable types for which there was no convincing interpretation; we develop here a semantics based on the category-theoretic idea of direct limit, so that the behaviour of a variable type on any domain is determined by its behaviour on finite ones, thus getting rid of the circularity of variable types. To do so, one has first to simplify somehow the extant semantic ideas, replacing Scott domains by the simpler and more finitary qualitative domains. The interpretation obtained is extremely compact, as shown on simple examples. The paper also contains the definitions of a very small `universal model of lambda-calculus, and investigates the concept totality.},

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},
